<h2 style="text-align: center;">TQ Blacksmith V 0.1.3</h2>
<p>
<br/>Greetings all!</p>
<p>This tool is for those who have farmed for years in Titan Quest and haven't found some items. And for those who want to experiment with different builds based on specific gear...</p>
<p>This tool creates almost all the items in the game. Even all monster infrequents and quest items! Including common and broken items is very overwhelming and of less use, so these kinds of items and affixes have not been excluded in the tool.
<br/>You can also set prefix, suffix, bonus or seed to created item(including epic and legendary items as well). You don't have to visit Durin to upgrade epic and legendary gear.</p>
<p>The tool has been tested on Titan Quest Anniversary Edition v 1.54, 1.56 and 1.57.&nbsp; Not sure about old versions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage:</span></strong>
<br/>1) Create a new character in main quest in the game. And visit first caravan. It is preferred not to use existing characters.
<br/>2) Save and exit the character. 
<br/>3) Open the TQ_Blacksmith.exe
<br/>4) Set game save path. e.g. C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\My Games\Titan Quest - Immortal Throne
<br/>5) Set game installation path. e.g. F:\Games\Titan Quest154
<br/>6) Select the character. Make sure the character is not open in the game, TQVault or any other application.
<br/>7) Character's first sack will be shown. Where you can put created items.
<br/>8) Go to menu 'Smithy -&gt; Create Item'. Creation wizard will pop up. Use Wizard to create an item.
<br/>9)New Item will be placed in the main stash.
<br/>10) To ease the implementation all created items are placed at (0,0) location in the stash. Inside the game you can unstack them.</p>
<p>11)'File-&gt;Save Changes' will save created items in character save file. Inside game you can put the items in Transfer Area to share with other characters. Also backup of original file will be created: BlaksmithBackup_Player.chr.
<br/>OR
<br/>You can save changes to other location by clicking menu 'File-&gt;Save to...'. It'll save Player.chr, which you can use to replace main save file to unload items later.
<br/>12) 'Smithy-&gt;Empty the sack' removes all items from sack. So make sure you've unloaded all the created items in game.</p>
<p>
<br/><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips/warnings:</span></strong>
<br/>1) You can set item seed on bottom right corner of 'Select Item' Page in creation wizard.
<br/>2) Having quest items in stash before time could break the quest. So be careful not have such items.
<br/>3) log.txt contains logs. if the application throws error check the log file.
<br/>4) detailLogs=True could be set in Configurations.txt file to have detailed logs.
<br/>5) If you face file access errors, try to run the application exe with admin privileges.</p>
<br/>6) If you are not able to modify settings in application, then close the application and edit Configurations.txt.</p>
